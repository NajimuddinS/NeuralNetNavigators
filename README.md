## Features
- **Algorithm Visualization:** Watch sorting algorithms visually step through their operations.
- **Interactive Interface:** Easily adjust parameters and input data to see algorithmic changes in real time.
- **Multiple Algorithms and Data Structures:** Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms and data structures such as:
  - Two Pointer Approach 
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Linked List
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Binary Search
  - Sliding Window
  - Sieve of Eratosthenes
- **Clear Visualization:** Visual representation of data structures and algorithmic processes.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures compatibility and usability across different devices and screen sizes.
- **No Authentication Required:** Immediate access and usage without the need for authentication.

## Design Decisions and Assumptions
- **JavaScript for Algorithm Implementation:** Ensures compatibility and ease of use.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience.
- **Minimalistic Design:** Focuses on clarity and user engagement.

## Installation & Getting Started
To set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Algorithm-Visualizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd NeuralNetNavigators
    ```

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the visualizer.

## Credentials
No authentication is required for this application.

## APIs Used
No external APIs are utilized in this project.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Stylesheets for visual styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the visualizations.

## Usage
For the Algorithm Visualizer project, the primary technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the foundational structure, styling, and interactivity of the visualizations. These are complemented by Bootstrap for responsive design, D3.js for data-driven manipulation of visuals, and Animate.css for adding dynamic animations.
