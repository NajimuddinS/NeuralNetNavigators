    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Algorithm-Visualizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd NeuralNetNavigators
    ```

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the visualizer.

## Credentials
No authentication is required for this application.

## APIs Used
No external APIs are utilized in this project.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Stylesheets for visual styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the visualizations.

## Usage
For the Algorithm Visualizer project, the primary technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the foundational structure, styling, and interactivity of the visualizations. These are complemented by Bootstrap for responsive design, D3.js for data-driven manipulation of visuals, and Animate.css for adding dynamic animations.
