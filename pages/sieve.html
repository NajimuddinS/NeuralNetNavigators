        <h2>What is the Sieve of Eratosthenes?</h2>
        <p>
            The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It is one of the most efficient ways to find small prime numbers and is named after the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes.
        </p>
        <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>List all numbers from 2 to the maximum number you want to check.</li>
            <li>Start with the first number (2) and mark all its multiples as non-prime.</li>
            <li>Move to the next unmarked number and mark all its multiples as non-prime.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process until you have processed each number in the list.</li>
            <li>The remaining unmarked numbers are prime.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Visualization:</h3>
        <p>
            Click the "Visualize" button to see the Sieve of Eratosthenes in action. The numbers will be displayed in a 10x10 grid, and the algorithm will highlight each number as it processes them. Prime numbers will be highlighted in green, non-prime numbers in red, and numbers currently being processed in yellow.
