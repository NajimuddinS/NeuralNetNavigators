            <h2>Two Pointer Approach Overview</h2>
            <p>The two-pointer approach is a simple yet effective algorithm technique used to solve problems involving arrays or lists. 
                It involves using two pointers to traverse the data structure from different directions. But it requires the data to be sorted.
                This method helps in optimizing solutions by reducing time complexity, especially for problems like finding pairs or merging sorted arrays.</p>
            
            <h2>How Two Pointer Approach Works?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Initialize Pointers:</span> Set two pointers at the desired starting positions, usually at the beginning and end of the array.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Move Pointers:</span> Adjust the pointers based on the requirements, such as moving pointers forward and backward.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Check Condition:</span> Two pointers move towards each other until they cross, evaluating conditions to find solutions.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Update Pointers:</span> Modify the positions of the pointers based on the result of the condition check.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Advantages of Using Two Pointer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Optimized Performance:</span> Significantly reduces time complexity compared to brute-force methods.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Simple Implementation:</span> Straightforward to code and debug.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Memory Efficient:</span> Typically requires constant space, making it space efficient.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Disadvantage of Using Two Pointer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Sorted Data Requirement:</span> Often requires the data to be sorted, which may involve additional preprocessing.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Two Pointer Variations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Fixed Distance Pointers:</span> Pointers move in a fixed pattern relative to each other.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Opposite Direction Pointers:</span> Pointers start at opposite ends and move towards each other.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Same Direction Pointers:</span> Pointers move in the same direction but at different speeds or steps.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Real-World Examples of Two Pointer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Array Pair Sum:</span> Finding pairs of numbers in an array that add up to a specific sum.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Detecting cycle in a Linked List:</span> Identify cycles in a linked list using two pointers.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Checking Palindrome:</span> Verify if sequences read the same backward and forward.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Two-Sum Problem:</span> Solving the classic two-sum problem efficiently.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Finding the Middle of a Linked List:</span> Locate the central node using slow and fast pointers.</li>
